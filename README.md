This web application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide current and future weather information for cities across the globe.
The API uses latitude and longitude to search for the cities.

The website is built using the following technologies:
-Javascript
-CSS

-jQuery
-DayJS
The page features a search bar on the top of the page which allows the user to search for a city by name.

The search results will display the following information:
-City name
-Date
-Icon of the current weather
-Temperature
-Wind speed
-Humidity

A "favourite" button is available which allows the user to save a search result to local storage.
The saved results can be accessed through a "saved" dropdown menu.

The "saved" dropdown menu includes:
-A search button for searching the saved result
-A delete button for removing the result from local storage and the saved dropdown.
